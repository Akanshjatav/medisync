        <h2>What We Don't Do</h2>
        <p>
          It's important to understand the scope and limitations of MediSync:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Not a Clinical Tool:</strong> MediSync is an inventory management platform, not a clinical decision support system. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations.</li>

          <li><strong>Not a Prescription System:</strong> MediSync tracks dispensing activities but does not generate or validate prescriptions. Clinical decisions remain the sole responsibility of licensed healthcare professionals.</li>
          <li><strong>Not a Quality Certifier:</strong> While we facilitate vendor-pharmacy transactions, MediSync does not verify product quality, authenticity, or regulatory compliance. These remain the responsibility of vendors and pharmacy quality assurance teams.</li>
