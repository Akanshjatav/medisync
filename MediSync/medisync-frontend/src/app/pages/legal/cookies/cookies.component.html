        <h3>Impact of Blocking Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Warning:</strong> Disabling or blocking cookies, particularly strictly necessary cookies, will significantly impair MediSync functionality:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>You will not be able to log in or maintain an authenticated session</li>
          <li>Your preferences and settings will not be saved</li>
          <li>Platform performance may be degraded</li>

      <section class="static-section">
        <h2>Do Not Track (DNT)</h2>
        <p>
          Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) signal that requests websites not to track user activity. Currently, there is no industry consensus on how to respond to DNT signals.
        </p>
        <p>
          MediSync does not respond to DNT signals because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We do not use cookies for advertising or cross-site tracking</li>
          <li>Most cookies we use are essential for platform functionality</li>
          <li>Our analytics are focused on platform improvement, not user profiling</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="static-section">
        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are retained for the durations specified in the tables above. Once a cookie expires or is deleted:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Session cookies are automatically removed when you close your browser</li>
          <li>Persistent cookies expire after their designated lifespan</li>
          <li>You can manually delete cookies at any time through browser settings</li>
